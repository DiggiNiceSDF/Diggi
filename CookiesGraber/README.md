# Features
	🟢Grabs Cookie from Edge, Opera (O or O-GX), Chrome, etc.
	🟢Sends Robux, Premium Status, Username, IP Address, RAP, Creation Date & Age
	🟢Sends all cookie results instead of just one in a singular message.

 # Changelog - (>2.0)
 	(7/28/23) 2.2.2 - Checked for already existing cookies and returns if there is one found.
 	(7/17/23) 2.2.1 - Implemented a try/except piece of code over the IP Address whenever trying to fetch it, as sometimes it may error out due to a PC's client being fucked.
 	(7/16/23) 2.2.0 - A rewrite of the code that boasts a small performance improvement as it sends one request compared to multiple requests last time. 
 	(7/15/23) 2.1.0 - Fixed a bug related to discord's fucked 1024 character limit on embed fields, the cookie, and all related information is in the description.
